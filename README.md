# coral_project
This is my final project for the MBIO 691I course at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. The purpose of this project was to create three different figures that showcased and analyzed the dataset we were given looking at currernt and future coral cover as well as other oceanographic variables.

The scripts in this repository are used to read, organize, and visualize the data within the Coral_Dataset folder. Specific analyses that were visuallized from the data include looking at average coral cover in 2020 and 2100 as a function of latitude, average coral cover loss from 2020 to 2100 as a function of latitude, and average coral cover loss from 2020 to 2100 as a function of SST change.

These graphs can easily be replicated with the script in the repository and the original dataset or can be used for other similar datasets to produce the same analyses on other datasets.
