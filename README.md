# coral_project

This is my final project for the MBIO 691I course at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. 

Description: 

The purpose of this project was to create three different figures that showcased and analyzed the dataset we were given looking at current and future coral cover as well as other oceanographic variables. All work was done using Python on the Positron IDE.

The script, when used with the appropriate dataset, was used to create three different graphs depicting:
- Average coral cover in the years 2020 and 2100 as a funtion of latitude
- Average coral cover loss between the years 2020 and 2100 as a function of latitude
- Average coral cover loss between the years 2020 and 2100 as a function of sea surface temperature change

How To Use:
